## Usage

- You are designing a restaurant website and you want to add random food pictures as placeholders.
- You are creating a guess the food dish game.
- You are ordering a pizza but you just want a random choice, visit https://foodish-js.netlify.app/?foodish=pizza because that's fun! Didn't like the pizza? Just hit refresh!
- You just like to see food pictures (visual hunger) because _you eat with your eyes first._
